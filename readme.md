# IPO GMP Notifier

This project is an automated system that scrapes IPO (Initial Public Offering) data from the **InvestorGain** website, filters IPOs based on their **GMP (Grey Market Premium)** and **rating**, and sends email alerts to subscribers. The system is designed to help investors identify potentially lucrative IPOs by focusing on those with high GMP and strong ratings.

## What is GMP?

**GMP (Grey Market Premium)** is the premium at which IPO shares are traded in the grey market before they are officially listed on the stock exchange. It is a key indicator of market sentiment and demand for the IPO. A high GMP suggests strong investor interest, which often correlates with positive listing gains. While GMP is not a guaranteed predictor of performance, it is a useful first indicator for identifying IPOs worth investigating further.

## About InvestorGain

The project scrapes data from [InvestorGain](https://www.investorgain.com/report/live-ipo-gmp/331/), a website that provides real-time updates on IPO GMP and other related metrics. InvestorGain uses a **fire rating system** to evaluate IPOs:

- **üî•üî•üî•üî• (4/5 stars)**: Indicates a GMP of **25% or higher**. These IPOs are considered strong candidates for further investigation.
- **üî•üî•üî•üî•üî• (5/5 stars)**: Indicates an even higher GMP and demand.

The notifier focuses on IPOs with ratings of **4/5 or 5/5**, ensuring that only high-potential IPOs are flagged for attention.

## About the Script

The script is built using **Python** and **Selenium** for web scraping. It automates the process of:

1. **Scraping IPO Data**: The script navigates to the InvestorGain website, extracts IPO details (name, status, estimated listing gains, open/close dates, and rating), and filters the data based on:
   - **Close Date**: Only IPOs closing within the next 3 days are considered.
   - **Rating**: Only IPOs with a rating of 4/5 or 5/5 are selected.

2. **Sending Email Alerts**: The script sends an HTML-formatted email to subscribers with details of the qualifying IPOs. The email includes:
   - IPO name
   - Status (e.g., "Open", "Closed")
   - Estimated listing gains
   - Open and close dates
   - Rating

3. **Encryption**: The script uses **Fernet encryption** to securely store and retrieve email recipient details.
